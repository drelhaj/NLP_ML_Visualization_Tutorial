Aus texttypologischer Sicht handelt es sich aber eher um einen PR-Text, der so aussieht, als sei er ein Auszug aus einer Wahlkampfbroschüre. Der Vortrag analysiert den Text zunächst inhaltlich, um zu zeigen, worum es im Einzelnen geht und wo Widersprüche auftauchen, dann aus textkritischer und aus linguistischer Perspektive. Insbesondere werden bestimmte Interessen der Bundesregierung und anderer Akteure deutlich, die weniger offen thematisiert werden, aber doch sprachlich zu Tage treten."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""

Over the past year, I helped lead the first rigorous, independent securityz evaluation of the system, based on election observation, code review, and laboratory testing. The findings are alarming: there are staggering gaps in Estonia's procedural and operational securityz, and the architecture of the system leaves it open to cyberattackz from foreign powers. Our investigation confirmed the viability of these attackz in the lab, but the Estonian government has chosen to downplay them.

The vulnerability was one of the most consequential in the history of the Internet, since it allowed attackzers to potentially steal login credentials, cryptographic keys, and other private data from up to half of all popular HTTPS sites.  In this talk, we take a detailed look at Heartbleed and its aftermath, based on comprehensive measurements and analysis that our research team performed over the past six months.  We began tracking Heartbleed's impact within hours of its disclosure using massive ZMap scans and large network telescopes.  This allowed us to track which sites remained securityz, observe certificate revocations, and monitor for large scale attackz in close to real time. Based on this data, we also conducted one of the largest ever mass vulnerability notifications, informing the network administrators for all devices still susceptible to Heartbleed across the entire IPv4 address space.  Finally, we investigated the question of whether attackzers knew about and securityzed Heartbleed prior to its public disclosure---and we will present new details about this question in the talk.  We hope that by learning from the Heartbleed securityz disaster, our community can prepare to respond more effectively to such events in the future.

"2014"|"31C3"|"Source Code and Cross-Domain Authorship Attribution: post-existentialism is the question, not post-privacy"|"Stylometry is the study of linguistic style found in text. Stylometry existed long before computers but now the field is dominated by artificial intelligence techniques.  Writing style is a marker of identity that can be found in a document through linguistic information to perform authorship recognition. Authorship recognition is a threat to anonymity but knowing ways to identify authors provides methods for anonymizing authors as well. Even basic stylometry systems reach high accuracy in classifying authors correctly.  Stylometry can also be used in source code to identify the author of a program. In this talk, we investigate methods to de-anonymize source code authors of C++ and authors across different domains. Source code authorship attribution could provide proof of authorship in court, automate the process of finding a cyber criminal from the source code left in an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright, copyleft and plagiarism issues in the programming fields. Programmers can obfuscate their variable or function names, but not the structures they subconsciously prefer to use or their favorite increment operators. Following this intuition, we create a new feature set that reflects coding style from properties derived from abstract syntax trees. We reach 99% accuracy in attributing 36 authors each with ten files. We experiment with many different sized datasets leading to high true positive rates.  Such a unique representation of coding style has not been used as a machine learning feature to attribute authors and therefore this is a valuable contribution to the field.   We also examine the need for cross-domain stylometry, where the documents of known authorship and the documents in question are written in different contexts. Specifically, we look at blogs, Twitter feeds, and Reddit comments. While traditional methods in stylometry that work well within one domain fail to identify authors across domains, we are able to improve the accuracy of cross-domain stylometry to as high as 80%. Being able to identify authors across domains facilitates linking identities across the Internet making this a key privacy concern; users can take other measures to ensure their anonymity, but due to their unique writing style, they may not be as anonymous as they believe.

It is not that easy to find pages that were made in 93-97 and are still online or look the same. Things changed in 2009, when Yahoo announced that they are closing Geocities, number one free hosting service of the last century, ""myspace of the 90es"", first home for many web users and a jest for ""professional web""  In half a year yahoo gave its users to copy their data, Archive Team managed to partly rescue the pages and release one terabyte torrent of it. In 2010 my partner Dragan Espenschied and I started to download the files. In the middle of 2011 Dragan restored the archive and we started to go through the profiles: collecting, tagging, comparing, analyzing. One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age project started.  We don't only collect and restore but bring this culture of the 90es back to the web, using contemporary infrastructure. It is http://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/ that posts a screenshot of a page every 20 minutes since February 2013. Or my channel on Vine, that allows to see those pages animated and with sound. And of course the blog http://contemporary-home-computing.org/1tb/ where we describe the findings.  In my HIGHLY ILLUSTRATED talk I'd like to introduce to the audience pearls of the early web culture, going much deeper than usual Under Construction signs and animated GIFs nostalgia. Will show what did it mean to make a web page technically, philosophically and ideologically. Will also talk about our unique technical setting for emulating the pages and what digital preservation really means.  And last but not least will talk about newer cases of deleted social networks and social services."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""

What can a play from 1605 tell us about fairer distribution of natural resources today? Equally, how might a cyber thriller from 2011 help us debate contentious issues such as gene-based technologies and utopian visions of knowledge-led society? This talk considers agri-tech and food securityz across a wide sweep of social and political terrain, from the Arab Spring to the European horsemeat scandal, from Shakespeare to Daniel Suarez. It argues that the arts and sciences need to cooperate to deepen understanding about, and define actions on, the big challenges facing a needy world. Finally, it suggests ways in which the arts and technology can assist us in arriving at a model of society in which resources are distributed not only more efficiently, but also more equitably."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""

For example, antivirenz scans are a critical component of layered defense-in-depth, but in the cloud they rapidly exhaust available CPU and memory. The cloud environment nevertheless offers a unique opportunity: the ability to peer into a running operating system from an outside perspective, known as virtual machine introspection (VMI). More interestingly, it is also possible to alter the behavior of the virtualized components to help protect virtual systems in real-time. In this talk we will explore the open-source LibVMI library which over the last year, as part of the DARPA Cyber Fast Track program, has been significantly extended to ease the process of developing cloud securityz solutions."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""
