Im Jahr 2008 sind diese Irrtümer so häufig widerlegt worden wie noch nie: Datenskandale bei LIDL, Telekom und dutzenden anderen, per Internet zugängliche Meldedaten, Massenverkauf von Bank- und Telefondaten – eine Liste ohne Ende im Datenskandaljahr 2008."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/schedule.en.xml"|""
"2008"|"25C3"|"The Trust Situation: Why the idea of data protection slowly turns out to be defective"|"In many social situations, people start to adjust their behaviour due to surveillance. Inspired by more and more cases of breaches of data protection regulations, an erosion of trust into these regulations and those who forfeit them can be seen. The consequences of this are grim. Either we abolish surveillance technologies or the idea of ""informational self-determination"". "|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/schedule.en.xml"|""

The investigation is *still* going on though. In the course of my new preoccupation 'terrorzism' I keep hearing about similarly absurd cases of such investigations. All different, but all with analogies. All hard to bear for those who are subjected tot them.

Today we work toward infinite libraries and perfect memory with little heed for the possible consequences. How could it be bad to have everything possible stored? To remember everything? I don't know that it will be bad, but I do know that it will be different from our current lives of loss and forgetting. Right now, storing pornography causes problems even for people who have nothing especially perverted to hide: A collection of pornography gets to the heart of what it means to be a private individual. As we move from mass media to individually produced media, from edited collections of porn (magazines, commercially produced films) to individual snapshots and youtube clips and stored bittorrents, the particularity of a collection of porn will be testimony to its owner's private set of tastes."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/schedule.en.xml"|""
