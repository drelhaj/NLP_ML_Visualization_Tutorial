You can use SSH and IPsec to protect communication with your own machines, but how do you talk to the rest of the Internet? You can use TCPcrypt to protect yourself against attackzers too lazy to forge packets, but how do you protect yourself against serious attackzers? You can use HTTPS for low-frequency communication, but how do you handle heavy network traffic, and how do you protect yourself against the securityz flaws in HTTPS? Today's Internet cryptography is slow, untrustworthy, hard to use, and remarkably unsuccessful as a competitor to good old unprotected TCP.  This talk will present a different approach to high-securityz Internet cryptography. This approach is easy for users, easy for system administrators, and, perhaps most importantly, easy for programmers. The main reason that the approach has not been tried before is that it seems to involve very slow cryptographic operations; this talk will show that the approach is extremely fast when it is done right."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/schedule.en.xml"|""

I spent over 6 years not able to speak to anyone (other than my lawyers) about my case - forced to lie to those closest to me due to an FBI gag order that carried a possible 10 year prison sentence for violating it.   However the lawsuit resulted in the establishment of two key legal precedents and made changes that affect every Internet worker and Telephone worker in America.    I would like to speak to the 27C3 audience in order to tell about my experience and to challenge (and offer my support and assistance to) those individuals who are in a position to challenge government surveillance requests to follow their consciences and do so.

Known to bank customers as “Chip and PIN”, it is used in Europe; it is being introduced in Canada; and there is pressure from banks to introduce it in the USA too. EMV securityzs credit and debit card transactions by authenticating both the card and the customer presenting it through a combination of cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, and the entry of a PIN. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a protocol flaw which allows criminals to use a genuine card to make a payment without knowing the card’s PIN, and to remain undetected even when the merchant has an online connection to the banking network."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/schedule.en.xml"|""
