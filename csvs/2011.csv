While politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have recently committed to ban the sale of such technologies to dictators, it's not clear whether such measures would prove effective (or merely drive the sale of such technologies underground) or simply stimulate the growth of Chinese, Russian and Indian companies. More disturbingly, there is still very little awareness – at least among the general public – that many of the tools that are currently exported to authoritarian states have been designed to help fight ""The Global War On terrorz"" and are thus inextricably linked to domestic policies of Western states."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/schedule.en.xml"|""

Just before anti-hackz laws were introduced in Germany? Back in these days, the famous founding father of the CCC made the Bundespost (Germany's Federal Mail Service) meet its Waterloo, when they hackzed Bildschirmtext (Btx)—the epitome of both technological utopias and dystopias at that time. But soon, hackzs suffered a setback: new laws criminalized hackz in the name of fighting white-collar crimes. Simultaneously to the laws, things were getting rougher in the media and the public opinion. While being seen as a weird vanguard of technology before, hackzs soon became pranksters and outlaws. Apparently hackztivism, the portmanteau word for hackz activism, had failed to shape the policies in the dawning information society.

We will be presenting a real-life implementation of unusual PostScript APIs (along with it's dissection and reconstructed documentation) that interact with various levels of OS and HW, implementation we have found in a TOP10 printer vendor product line.  Also, we will investigate whether a PostScript-based (hence platform-independent) virenz (18+ years after first proposals of such theory) can be acomplished, thus giving theoretical hints and few building blocks in this direction.

Then with the growing importance of web applications and of course search engines, a new way of identifying securityz systems was introduced: ""Google hackz"".   However this approach of identifying and scanning companies ip addresses as well as doing some Google hackz for the (known) URLs of the company doesn't take all aspects into account and has some limitations. At first we just check the systems which are obvious, the ones that are in the companies netblocks, the IP addresses that were provided by the company and the URLs that are known or can be resolved using reverse DNS. However how about URLs and systems that aren't obvious? Systems maybe even the company in focus forgot? Second, the current techniques are pretty technical. They don't take the business view into account at any point.  Therefore we developed a new technique as well as framework to identify companies’ web pages based on a scored keyword list.

Modern techniques have drastically cut cost and time needed to get an insight into one's genome and have ultimately led to the formation of personal genetics companies – like 23andMe, deCODEme and others – that now offer direct-to-customer genetic testing. With a price tag of those tests starting at about 100 €, the number of people that do such tests is on the rise. By now, 23andMe alone has over 100.000 paying customers, with over 60.000 of them willing to donate their genetic data and to actively participate in research projects by filling out surveys, e.g. on their medical histories. This has resulted in a high-quality dataset with genetic information of 60.000 individuals. The best part: The data has already been paid for by the participants in the research.   Who would not love to get their hands on data like this? Unfortunately, the data sits locked away in corporate vaults, inaccessible to interested (citizen) scientists. But what if we could change this?   We've created openSNP, a central, open source, free-to-use repository which lets customers of genotyping companies upload their genotyping data and annotate them with phenotypes. OpenSNP provides its users with the latest scientific research on their genotypes and lets scientists download annotated genotypes to make science more open."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/schedule.en.xml"|""

Are we ready?  This will be a co-presentation (Jean-Jacques Quisquater / David Samyde) and occasional friendly exchange, with point and counter-point of different contrasting views on the impact of solving integer factorization and some other difficult problem in cryptography.  The idea is to perform a provocative comparison between the 'unbreakable' RSA algorithm and the unsinkable Titanic.  Receiving his RSA Conference Lifetime Achievement Award, Rivest said that it has not been demonstrated mathematically that factorization into primes is difficult. So “Factoring could turn out to be easy,” and according to him “maybe someone here will find the method”.  Since 1994 and Shor's algorithm, the danger of quantum computer is known: breaking RSA in polynomial time. Factoring large numbers is conjectured to be computationally infeasible on classic non quantum computers. No efficient algorithm is known and the research in the last 30 years did not show enormous progress.  Iceberg existence is predicted but not shown yet.  According to Rivest a variety of alternative schemes have been developed in the decades since RSA was published, and a new system could probably be adopted quickly.  This relies on solving factorization only, but several other cases can be considered, in some of them the action to replace RSA with a new algorithm could require more work than initially planned (solution to discrete logarithm).  Managing the risk and the threat of the resolution of any major problem used in cryptography is crucial. This presentation challenges the conventional thinking using lessons learned from history.  RSA users are everywhere so what could be the consequences of a break in the real world? What were the errors made on the Titanic? Can the best practices used be improved or just translated into a new scheme? What would be the impact of solving the RSA assumption on cryptography?  The outline is: History of factorization Titanic primes and RSA keys Complexity, classes of algorithms and practical costs Risk analysis and Threat management Probability estimation and proactive monitoring From best to worst case Best methods and lessons learned Multiple scenari (Im)possibility of accurate prediction What to expect and how to be ready Conclusion  Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel said ""Only the paranoid survive"".

Eventually, JA used a biologistic argument on the benefits and drawbacks that uncontrolled leaking might pose for ""just"" and ""unjust"" systems, arriving at the conclusion that ""unjust"" systems are hurt more and thus will be less viable, essentially being destroyed by more ""just"" systems. While an innovative proposal, the underlying assumptions on complexity, network theory, and especially the evolutionary perspectives were never critically assessed. Some blogs and media raised questions on details and potential threats to innocent bystanders. Still, fundamental problems with the philosophy were never addressed.  This paper argues against the general validity of such theories. In particular, we will refute some of the biologistic arguments. Theoretical biology has long ago pointed out the hidden complexity in evolutionary processes and as such the envisioned ""leaking revolution"" might be a limited artifact: there might even arise situations where the leaking envisioned and encouraged by Wikileaks and the like can actually strengthen some ""conspiracies"".   In this paper I will describe some research questions, that should be answered before given the “leaking philosophy” an unconditioned “thumbs-up”. Empirically, for example, a potential strengthening is illustrated by the rise of a 'neo-feudalistic economy', which is linked closely to the paradigm of ""intellectual property"" as it is to the securityz-financial-political complex. The players have effectively created a closed network or a ""conspiracy"" and might be resilient towards Wikileaks-like attackz. The paper concludes with an alternative to that proposal; in particular, a way to deal with the 'conspiracy' that might be coined the rise of the neo-feudalistic society (which in itself is a self-sustainable, self-amplifying feedback loop, not necessarily a conscious conspiracy).
