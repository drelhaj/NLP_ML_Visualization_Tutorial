"2017"|"34C3"|"Dude, you broke the Future!: Warum das Laden eines Elektroautos unsicher ist"|"We're living in yesterday's future, and it's nothing like the speculations of our authors and film/TV producers. As a working science fiction novelist, I take a professional interest in how we get predictions about the future wrong, and why, so that I can avoid repeating the same mistakes. Science fiction is written by people embedded within a society with expectations and political assumptions that bias us towards looking at the shiny surface of new technologies rather than asking how human beings will use them, and to taking narratives of progress at face value rather than asking what hidden agenda they serve.  In this talk, author Charles Stross will give a rambling, discursive, and angry tour of what went wrong with the 21st century, why we didn't see it coming, where we can expect it to go next, and a few suggestions for what to do about it if we don't like it.

Two key questions to ask are: Are the specifications of the Trusted Computing Base correct? And do the implementations match the specifications? I will explore the philosophical challenges and practical steps you can take in answering that question for one of the major dependencies: the hardware your software runs on. I will describe the combination of formal verification and testing that ARM uses to verify the processor specification and I will talk about our current challenge: getting the specification down to zero bugs while the architecture continues to evolve."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""

It does so through the context of technology and political discourse in contemporary art. With a view from the battle fields of the Middle East, both real and imagined, I attempt to dissect how the political discourse of academia and the art world trickles down to everyday discussions. A simple word such as ""assassination"" becomes rife with racism when its etymology can be linked to anti-Muslim propaganda that originated during the Crusades. And today assassination is the primary political tool of the West to negotiate with Muslim radicals, even violating their own rules of citizenship, constitutional, and human rights protections in the process. With this backdrop, we see how the artistic works of such diverse artists such as Chris Marker, Chris Burden, Haroun Farouki, Anish Kapoor, and Banksy have evolved to reflect the political discourse of the moment. The digital advancements of the war zone, I argue, are reflected in the diametrically opposed peaceful spaces of the gallery, museum, or art house cinema. As the digital defeats analogue, the act of killing becomes disconnected from the killer, with democracies spreading thei blame over systemic failures rather than facing the reality of death.

However, also Diameter offers a rich functionality set, which can be also exploited and misused, if the network is not properly protected. We will show in this lecture, how data interception (MiM) can be done via the diameter based interconnection link."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""

This situation raised our awareness on the lack of research in our community about operating and detecting spying microphones. Our biggest concern was that most of the knowledge came from fictional movies. Therefore, we performed a deep study on the state-of-the-art of microphone bugs, their characteristics, features and pitfalls. It included real life experiments trying to bug ourselves and trying to detect the hidden mics. Given the lack of open detection tools, we developed a free software SDR-based program, called Salamandra, to detect and locate hidden microphones in a room. After more than 120 experiments we concluded that placing mics correctly and listening is not an easy task, but it has a huge payoff when it works. Also, most mics can be detected easily with the correct tools (with some exceptions on GSM mics). In our experiments the average time to locate the mics in a room was 15 minutes. Locating mics is the novel feature of Salamandra, which is released to the public with this work. We hope that our study raises awareness on the possibility of being bugged by a powerful actor and the countermeasure tools available for our protection."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""

Interestingly, the susceptibility of electronic devices to electromagnetic interference has been advertised since the 90’s. Regarding the high integration of sensors and digital systems to control power-grids, telecom networks and automation infrastructures (e.g. Smart-grids, Industrial Control Systems), the intrinsic vulnerability of electronic devices to electromagnetic interference is of fundamental interest. In the context of IT Security, few studies have been carried out to understand how the effects may be a significant issue especially in the far-field region (distance between the transmitter’s antenna and the target with regard to the wavelength/central frequency). Most studies in Emanation Security (EMSEC) are related to near-field probing for side-channel and fault injection attacks assuming a close physical access to the targeted devices. In this paper, we propose a methodology to detect, classify and correlate the effect induced during the intentional exposure of analogue and digital systems to electromagnetic interference. Applying this methodology, the implication of the effects for the IT security world will be discussed with regards to the attacker profile needed to set-up a given scenario.

The radio signal is AES-128 encrypted and the system is marketed to be “as secure as online banking”. In comparison to conventional and often trivial to break wireless access control systems, the system should thus make it practically infeasible to clone a genuine transmitter so that attackers can get unauthorized access. We used the low-cost CCC rad1o software defined radio (SDR) platform to intercept and analyze the wireless radio signal. We took apart several Hoermann BiSecur hand transmitters and subsequently utilized a vulnerability in the microcontroller to successfully extract the firmware. In order to conduct a security audit, the extracted firmware was disassembled and analyzed so that the encryption mechanism, the key material, the cryptographic operations as well as the RF interface could be reverse engineered. Our security analysis shows that the overall security design is sound, but the manufacturer failed to properly initialize the random seed of the transmitters. As a result, an attacker can intercept an arbitrary radio frame and trivially compute the utilized encryption key within less than a second. Once the key is known to the attacker, a genuine transmitter can be cloned with an SDR platform such as the CCC rad1o. In addition to unauthorized operation of gates and doors, there is a likely (although currently untested) impact on Smart Home appliances that use the BiSecur system. We tested a total of 7 hand transmitters from 3 different model series and with manufacturing dates between 2015 and 2017. All analyzed hand transmitters shared the same static random seed and were found to be vulnerable to our attack. The vulnerability can easily be fixed so that future hand transmitters and radio transmission are protected from our attack."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""

Interestingly, there is a second way to look at them. From a physicist's perspective, wireless radiation is just light, more precisely: coherent electromagnetic radiation. It is virtually the same as the beam of a laser, except that its wavelength is much longer (cm vs µm).   We have developed a way to visualize this radiation, providing a view of the world as it would look like if our eyes could see wireless radiation.   Our scheme is based on holography, a technique to record three-dimensional pictures by a phase-coherent recording of radiation in a two-dimensional plane. This technique is traditionally implemented using laser light. We have adapted it to work with wireless radiation, and recorded holograms of building interiors illuminated by the omnipresent stray field of wireless devices. In the resulting three-dimensional images we can see both emitters (appearing as bright spots) and absorbing objects (appearing as shadows in the beam). Our scheme does not require any knowledge of the data transmitted and works with arbitrary signals, including encrypted communication.   This result has several implications: it could provide a way to track wireless emitters in buildings, it could provide a new way for through-wall imaging of building infrastructure like water and power lines. As these applications are available even with encrypted communication, it opens up new questions about privacy.   "|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""

Darauf aufsetzend können nicht nur ansehnliche Präsentationen erstellt werden, insbesondere ermöglicht IIIF es, institutionsübergreifend Daten verknüpfbar zu machen und virtuelle Arbeitsoberflächen einrichtungsunabhängig zu realisieren. Dem Linked Data Prinzip folgend, sind alle Daten standardisiert identifizierbar und nutzbar. Es existieren bereits viele leistungsfähige Open Source Anwendungen für IIIF. Der Talk führt in IIIF ein und zeigt viele anschauliche Beispiele, die bedeutende Werke aus namhaften Einrichtungen weltweit enthalten."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""
"2017"|"34C3"|"WHWP: is there no such thing as open hardware?"|"Vorstellung der Dissertation ""WHWP - Walter Höllerer bei WikiPedia"". Es wurde ein  einzelner Artikel in der deutschen WikiPedia untersucht. Es wird dargestellt, welchen  Einfluss die beteiligten Autoren auf die Qualität des WikiPedia-Artikels über Walter  Höllerer hatten und weiterhin haben. Dafür wurden 113 Veränderungen durch 89 Autoren  einzeln untersucht und bezüglich ihrer Relevanz bewertet. Es wurden auch  die Entwicklungen berücksichtigt, die seit der französischen Encyclopédie zur  Online-Enzyklopädie WikiPedia geführt haben. Daraus ist eine bisher einzigartige  Arbeit über die Produktion von Wissen und Wissenssammlungen entstanden. "|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""
"2017"|"34C3"|"openPower - the current state of commercial openness in CPU development: Rosa Menkman investigates video compression, feedback, and glitches"|"How does developing future processors with yesterdays capabilities work out today? CPU development is something out of focus these days. In this lecture I would like to show the state-of-the-art processor development flow of POWER processors from the first initial ideas to post-silicon testing. Apart from x86 Intel products there have been initiatives across the hardware industry to form some alternative business model. I would like to show if and how this compares to real open principals."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""
"2017"|"34C3"|"institutions for Resolution Disputes"|"The institutions of Resolution Disputes [iRD] call attention to media resolutions. While a ’resolution’ generally simply refers to a standard (measurement) embedded in the technological domain, the iRD reflect on the fact that a resolution is indeed a settlement (solution), but at the same time a space of compromise between different actors (objects, materialities and protocols) who dispute their stakes (framerate, number of pixels etc.) within the growing digital territories."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""

"2017"|"34C3"|"Uncertain Concern"|"Over 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States today. Immediately after taking office, the Trump administration issued two executive orders pumping resources into border and immigration enforcement agencies, heightening fears of deportation, harassment, and family separation among immigrant communities. In the following months reports emerged of increased immigration enforcement activity and hints about the deployment of new high-tech methods by the immigration enforcement agency. I will discuss the current state of immigration enforcement in the US and associated surveillance capabilities, the results of a study with undocumented immigrants about their technology practices, and the takeaways for the technology and privacy community in supporting communities of heightened risk."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""
"2017"|"34C3"|"Type confusion: discovery, abuse, and protection: reject the default reality^W abstractions and substitute your own"|"Type confusion, often combined with use-after-free, is the main attack vector to compromise modern C++ software like browsers or virtual machines. Typecasting is a core principle that enables modularity in C++. For performance, most typecasts are only checked statically, i.e., the check only tests if a cast is allowed for the given type hierarchy, ignoring the actual runtime type of the object. Using an object of an incompatible base type instead of a derived type results in type confusion. Attackers have been abusing such type confusion issues to compromise popular software products including Adobe Flash, PHP, Google Chrome, or Firefox, raising critical security concerns.  We discuss the details of this vulnerability type and how such vulnerabilities relate to memory corruption. Based on an LLVM-based sanitizer that we developed, we will show how to discover such vulnerabilities in large software through fuzzing and how to protect yourself against this class of bugs."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""
"2017"|"34C3"|"library operating systems: A decentralized Public Key Infrastructure that supports privacy-friendly social verification"|"Traditional models of application development involve talking to an underlying operating system through abstractions of its choosing.  These abstractions may or may not be a good fit for your language or application, but you have no choice but to use them - you can only layer more abstractions on top of them, to try to lessen the pain of a bad match.  Library operating systems let you write applications that use better abstractions in your own language - either someone else's abstractions, or your own."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""

A vouching mechanism among users, similar to the Web of Trust, assists with social authentication but without revealing the users' social graph. High-integrity data structures prevent equivocation and help detect compromises; the protocol can support generic claims (conventional PGP, modern OTR/Signal etc.); and a prototype evaluation indicates that ClaimChain can scale."|"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/schedule.xml"|""
